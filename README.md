#Online BookStore API
___A comprehensive Library Management API tailored for seamless integration into digital platforms, perfect for powering online book repositories and literary platformsüìö.___

###üë®‚ÄçüíªTech stack
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/): provides a set of pre-built templates and conventions for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/): simplifies the interaction between Java applications and databases by mapping Java objects to database tables and vice versa.
- [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security/): provides features like authentication, authorization, and protection against common security threats.
- [Spring Web](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ws/): includes tools for handling HTTP requests, managing sessions, and processing web-related tasks.
- [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa/): provides a higher-level abstraction for working with databases and includes support for JPA (Java Persistence API).
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/): helps reduce boilerplate code by automatically generating common code constructs (like getters, setters, constructors, etc.) during compile time.
- [Mapstruct](https://mapstruct.org/): generates mapping code based on annotations, reducing the need for manual, error-prone mapping code.
- [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.com/): helps manage database schema changes over time, making it easier to track and deploy database updates.
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/): provides a framework for generating interactive API documentation, allowing developers to understand, test, and use APIs more easily.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): provides a consistent and reproducible way to deploy applications across different environments.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): allows developers to create and send HTTP requests to test APIs, monitor responses, and automate testing workflows.

###üö¶Controllers
- _AuthenticationController_: handles user registration and authorization.
- _BookController_: handles book-related tasks, including the creation, modification, deletion, and retrieval of book information.
- _CartController_: oversees the status of the shopping cart, enabling users to add, modify, fetch, and remove items from the cart.
- _CategoryController_: handles category management, permitting administrators to perform actions such as creation, modification, retrieval, and deletion.
- _OrderController_: manages order-related tasks, including the creation, modification, deletion, and retrieval of order history.#Online BookStore API
